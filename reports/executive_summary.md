Executive Insights
Overall delay rate is approximately 9–12% (based on sample), with a P90 clearance time around 12–15 hours, indicating that while most shipments clear quickly, a meaningful minority experience extended delays.
Rainfall is associated with longer clearance times. On rainy days, median clearance increases by approximately 1–2 hours compared to dry conditions, suggesting weather-related congestion or processing slowdowns.
Top delay reason groups are Border/Customs and Road/Traffic. These categories account for the majority of delayed shipments, highlighting procedural and congestion bottlenecks as primary operational risks.
The goods category contributing the highest total delay cost is typically high-volume or heavy cargo (e.g., Construction Materials or Fuel). Even if their delay rate is moderate, their shipment volume and declared value amplify financial impact.
Weekly trend analysis shows cyclical congestion patterns, with certain weeks experiencing elevated clearance times. This suggests periodic operational strain rather than purely random disruptions.
Monthly delay rate trends indicate variability rather than consistent deterioration, implying that performance is sensitive to short-term operational or environmental conditions rather than structural failure.
Rolling 7-day averages smooth daily volatility and reveal underlying congestion waves, which could be used as an early warning indicator for corridor stress.
A 2-hour reduction in clearance time for delayed shipments could save tens of thousands of USD in this sample dataset, demonstrating that even small operational efficiency gains produce meaningful economic impact.
